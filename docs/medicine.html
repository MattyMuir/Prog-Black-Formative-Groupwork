    <h1>Medicine and Computer Science</h1>`
        <h2>What roles does Computer Science play in the development of treatments, diagnoses and preventative innovations in the field of Medicine?</h2>
            <p>With inc   reasing fear of the growing power of AI and its influence on modern society as well as discourse on social media and potential infringements of personal privacy, it is easy to view Computer Science as the root cause of many modern issues. Rarely do we reflect on its role in contributing to modern day medicine and accounting for many lives saved over the past few decades. Computer Science techniques and ideas have been used to enhance existing medical practices as well as innovate completely new ones. With steadily increasing life expectancy, one can't help but consider the number of lives saved by Computer Science's advancing technology. </p>
        <h3>Computational Modelling, especially with Coronavirus</h3>
            <p>Softwares can be used to create abstract or life-like models of drugs, genomes and new pathogens far quicker than any non-computational method; a recent example is the use during the Coronavirus pandemic. Models were used to simulate the spread of the disease as well as map its structure and create vaccines. The implementation of new machine learning-based data analysis allowed for a rapid response to the deadly virus that potentially saved thousands of lives. Another example are those at Columbia University, such as James Xu, who are using computational algorithms cancer biomarkers on large scale data sets as well produce visualisation models of certain cancer's genomics.
        <h3>Digital Health and Integrated Hardware, mobile applications</h3>
        <h3>Public Health Informatics</h3>
            <p>Computer Science Data Analysis softwares allow for the efficient and accurate processing of large volumes of data

        <h3>Accesibilty of Health Information from the Internet<h3>
            <p>Whilst the Internet is not accessible in some less privileged societies, generally it makes accessing and utilising health information easier than face-to-face and traditional methods. Websites such as the NHS, and even communal forums like Reddit, make it easier for the general public to identify their ailment and reach for treatments or preventative measures. While there is always a risk of unverified misinformation, trusted sources can be significantly more effective as diagnoses than GPs and private healthcare providers.
