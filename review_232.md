### Review Categories
*i*. Acceptable. Some pages seem unfinished but others are quite interesting and well written.

*ii*. Unacceptable. Every page has its own formatting, bootstrap is included but not used. Images are missing, styling feels very *dated*.

*iii*. Good. While some are short, every page is well written and readable.

*iv*. Perfect (apart from `medicine.html`, which has merge conflict issues)

*v*. Sound
- Author info not included on any pages, besides github links.
- 3/4 members appear to have roughly balanced contributions, but some pages (notably `education.html` and `science_and_engineering.html`) are very short.
- A few too many 'last-minute' commits, but overall it's clear that work has been done throughout the week.
