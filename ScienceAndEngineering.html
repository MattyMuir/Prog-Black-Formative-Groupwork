        <p>Improvements within the computing industry directly advance other industries, allowing them to complete task that would otherwise be impossible!</p>
        <p>Computing has made many positive contributions to Science and Engineering such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Computers with high performance are used to <a href="https://processecology.com/articles/dynamic-process-simulation-when-do-we-really-need-it">simulate dynamic process</a> in Science and Engineering.</li>
            <li>
                Supercomputers have numerous applications in area of Research and Development (R&D).
                <ul>
                    <li>Running vast simulations</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographic_map">Topographic images</a> can be created through computers.
                <ul>
                    <li>Satelite images can be converted into height maps of the ground</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Scientists use computers to plot and analyze data to have a better understanding of earthquakes.
                <ul>
                    <li>Allow us to create better earthquake proof structures.</li>
                    <li>Save lives.</li>
                    <li>Find at risk areas.</li>
