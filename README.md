Welcome to the project!

P.S. Sorry for all the commits, Github pages was refusing to work. Should all be fine now but you should now use
https://nathaka82.github.io/Prog-Black-Formative-Groupwork/images as the path for images.
https://nathaka82.github.io/Prog-Black-Formative-Groupwork/media as the path for media.

This isn't ideal but figured it would be better to try and get github pages working for the review on monday whilst we still had time to fix anything if it went wrong.
